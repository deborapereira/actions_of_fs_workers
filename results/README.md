All verbs were extracted from each book, using the code in action_verbs_extraction.m

Verbs unrelated to movement (actions or tasks) were discarded. The retained verbs were classified as action or task according to the specificity/complexity of the movement expressed by the verb. This specificity/complexity is expressed in the verb definition, btained complementarily from the culinary glossary in [1], the Oxford American Dictionary [4] and an online glossary [5].
